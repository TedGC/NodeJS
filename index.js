/**
 * The even loop operation at one queue 
 * 1. timers - execute setTiemOut and setInteval callbacks, functions such as these 
 * very much responstive will get on the working load immediately
 * 2. pending callbacks - executing I/O related (input & output -- disk & network
 * operations (~blocking operations ) ) callbacks that were defered 
 * 3. Poll - retreive new I/O events, execute their callbacks. If these callbacks are 
 * not yet to complete, NodeJs will send them over to the pending callbacks  
 * 4. check = execute setImmediate() callbacks, but after those callbacks mentioned above
 * 5. close callbacks - execute all 'close' event callbacks
